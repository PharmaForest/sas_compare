## `%ads_compare()` macro <a name="adscompare-macros-1"></a> ######

Program Name    : ads_compare.sas
Description     : Macro to compare SAS datasets between main and sub libraries.
It generates PDF reports for each dataset, checks differences using
PROC COMPARE, and outputs a summary report in Excel format.
Macro Name      : %ads_compare
Main Functions  :
- Iteratively compares a list of target datasets between two libraries.
- Creates a unique output folder using date and time.
- Generates PROC COMPARE reports as PDF files.
- Automatically renames the result files to indicate "OK" or "NG" compare-match status.
- Aggregates comparison results into a summary dataset.
- Exports the summary as an Excel file.
Parameters      :
output_folder : Full path to the folder where output files will be saved.
main_lib_path : Path to the main library containing the original ADaM datasets.
sub_lib_path  : Path to the sub library containing the comparison ADaM datasets.
target_list   : Space-delimited list of dataset names to compare.
Author          : Yutaka Morioka
Dependencies    : Requires SAS/BASE, SAS/ACCESS, and ODS PDF.
Usage Example   :
%ads_compare(
output_folder = D:/project/output,
main_lib_path = D:/project/main,
sub_lib_path  = D:/project/sub,
target_list   = A
